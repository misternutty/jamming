## Jamming

Jamming is a simple web app to search for music on spotify and save songs to a playlist. This is a project in the Codecademy React course. I am adding this repository so I can practice using version control with GitHub/VSCode.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
